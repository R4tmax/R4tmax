- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @R4tmax
- I started my CompSci Studies in 2019, when I wrote my first couple of codes, and IÂ´ve been working on myself ever since. Admittedly it was not always a pleasant or simple path for me.
- I primarily code in Java, but I have also written bunch of smaller codes in C, Python and Rust. I have experience working with Oracle and Postgres relational DBs and MongoDB Object oriented DB. I know how to put together a website with good old fashion HTML/CSS and very very small splash of JS. I also dabble in the world of DevOps, I am responsible for code deployment on some of my work projects, I maintain Docker Images and certain repositories involving them and have experience with both Linux and Microsoft Servers.
- One of the primary uses for my GitHub is organization of my personal and college projects.
