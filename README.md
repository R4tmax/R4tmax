- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @R4tmax
- I started my CompSci Studies in 2019, when I wrote my first couple of codes, and IÂ´ve been working on myself ever since. Admittedly it was not always a pleasant or simple path for me.
- I primarily code in Java, but I have also written bunch of smaller codes in C, Python and Rust. I have experience working with Oracle and Postgres relational DBs and MongoDB Object oriented DB. I know how to put together a website with good old fashion HTML/CSS and very very small splash of JS (I use Vue when I can). I also dabble in the world of DevOps, I am responsible for code deployment on some of my work projects, I maintain Docker Images (read: I know what they do and how to modify them) and certain repositories involving them and have experience with both Linux and Microsoft Servers. I am by no means an expert but learning is a process, right? (Right?!)
- I have experience as a SLA team lead and with technological consultancy with CybSec overlap both from a corporate and freelance perspective.
- I am currently trying to pave my way as a freelancer while dealing with the stress of academia. 
- One of the primary uses for my GitHub is organization of my personal and college projects. I would like to launch a site soon, covering topics I enagaged with as undergrad, such as transhumanism, AI, state of Web 2.0 and more!
